# CricStat
The website Cricstat is dedicated to providing statistics and scorecards for cricket. It 
offers live cricket match coverage, along with player statistics and team rankings. To 
illustrate various statistical analyses, we have employed graphical depiction in this 
case. It includes data about players, officials, teams, cricket boards, particular teams, 
and records. Since most matches are not scheduled during holidays, anyone can see 
scores at anytime from anywhere.
